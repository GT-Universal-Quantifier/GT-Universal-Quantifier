# GT: Universal Quantifier

GT: Universal Quantifier is a complex and realistic tech-centered survival modpack based around GregTech that exists to push limits of Modded Minecraft and yours with highest level of systemic, historical, physical, chemical and accurate realism including all eras of humanity. Starting from the earliest Paleolithic survival stages to advanced industrial and post-industrial technologies.

We are aiming for every mechanic, recipe and feature to feel grounded, justified, internally consistent and accurately realistic.

> The goal is not convenience, not speed, and not power fantasy.

> The goal is believability, progression, and consequence.

## Goals & Purposes
The primary goal of GT: Universal Quantifier is to pursue the maximum level of realism that is practically achievable within Modded Minecraft including micro-mechanics like torches needs to be lit before using them.
This realism is not limited to visuals or flavor, but extends deeply into:

- Physical behavior
- Historical accuracy
- Chemical and material logic
- Mechanical constraints
- Environmental interaction
- Human technological progression

Every system should feel like it exists for a reason. 
If something happens in the game world, there should be a believable explanation rooted in real-world logic, history, or physics whenever possible.

> Pack is currently in heavily work in progress. We are trying to make it playable as possible for first release.
